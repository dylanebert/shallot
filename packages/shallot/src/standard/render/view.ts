 * has a rendered color to read: writing the swapchain in place leaves nothing to read back. `depth` + `tag`
 * are the renderer's opt-in **prepass lanes**, each gated by a per-camera marker (sear's `Depth` / `Tag`).

 * carries `Depth`, read by screen-space consumers (AO, fog). `null` otherwise (a tag-only camera tests

 * prepass for a camera carrying `Tag`: the front-most opaque fragment's surface-authored tag per pixel
 * (`TAG_NONE` where no surface owns it, defaulting to the entity's eid for an instanced surface). It's
 * the `GPUTexture` (not a view, unlike `depth` / `framebuffer`) because its consumers need the texture:
 * a hover readback `copyTextureToBuffer`s the cursor pixel, and a view can't be turned back into a
 * texture; an outline pass `createView`s it to sample. `null` until the prepass has drawn the camera. A
 * canvas-bound view (`attachCanvas`) renders to that canvas; a canvas-less view (`attachView`) has
 * no `canvas` / `context` / `observer` and a null `framebuffer` / `present`. It still takes a cull slot
